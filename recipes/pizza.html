    <h3>Pesto Pizza!</h3>
    <p>Bonnie and I have been making great homemade pizza for years, but when I took my first bite of this pesto pizza, I knew that we’d outdone ourselves. To be honest, I was surprised. This pesto pizza recipe doesn’t call for any fancy ingredients or special techniques. It’s simple and classic, a delicious reminder of how flavorful seasonal ingredients, like summer tomatoes and garden-fresh basil, can be.</p>
    <p>If you find yourself with this summer bounty on hand in the next few weeks, I really hope you’ll try this pesto pizza. It’s so much more than the sum of its parts. Trust me, you don’t want to miss it.</p>

    <h3>Fettuccini Alfredo!</h3>
    <p>Traditional fettuccine Alfredo contains 5 basic ingredients: pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. If you’ve been reading the blog for a while, you’ve probably guessed that this fettuccine Alfredo recipe isn’t totally traditional. You’re right!</p>
    <p>See, I love creamy pasta, but when I order it at restaurants, it’s almost always too rich for me to enjoy for more than a few bites. Earlier this winter, I was craving comfort food, and I got the idea to make a fettuccine Alfredo recipe that would let me have my cake and eat it too. It would be every bit as creamy and comforting as the classic pasta, but also light enough for me to savor an entire bowlful and still go back for seconds.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces cauliflower florets, (1 small cauliflower)</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, more for serving</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>16 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 to 1½ cups reserved pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower and boil until the cauliflower is fork tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and place the cauliflower in a blender. Add the Parmesan cheese, olive oil, garlic, mustard, butter, lemon juice, salt, and several grinds of pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package directions or until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1½ cups of the starchy pasta water. Add 1 cup of the pasta water to the blender and blend the sauce until creamy.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta to a large bowl or skillet. Add the sauce and toss to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add the remaining ½ cup pasta water and toss again to loosen the sauce and make it a bit creamier.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley and season to taste. Serve with grated cheese on the side.</li>
    </ol>
